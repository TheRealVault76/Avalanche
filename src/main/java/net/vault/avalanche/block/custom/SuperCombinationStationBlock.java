/*
This is 1 block, with 4 parts. It should be possible to define the entire block in just one class.
The block models are already in the files.
The block takes up a 2*1*2 area, and can rotate based on the direction the player is facing.
The block looks like this:
    SCS 3 | SCS 4
    SCS 2 | SCS 1
Being only one block tall, this can be presented in 2D.
You do not need to define the block entity aspect yet, just the actual block itself.
